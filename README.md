# RealTimeVisualiser
a spectrum analyzer that uses real time windows audio output

Contains my own implementation of a fast fourier transform algorithm, written in C#, which is very inefficient

Quite scuffed in general, especially my use of the "component" base class and other classes for controls

this will likely never be finished
